/*6.	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2+2^2+3^2 … + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + 3 + … + 10) ^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. Ans: 25164150*/
